<p id="futur">The future is always uncertain, but I'd like to think that there a couple of things that we will probably do or have. No matter what the future holds for us, here's a list of things I think would happen later in our lives.</p>

<h2 id="future">1. We'll probably have a small wedding. It'll be cute and fun!</h2>
<h2 id="future">2. I'll often have to make you foods that will sit right in your stomach when you have tummy troubles.</h2>
<h2 id="future">3. We'll adopt a cute little Cockateil and he'll somehow tame Patty.</h2>
<h2 id="future">4. I'm going to say 'No' a lot when we go grocery shopping and you want something you shouldn't have.</h2>
<h2 id="future">5. We'll sleep early on weekdays and sleep later on weekends but not too late.</h2>
<h2 id="future">6. We might wake up early on weekends, but we'll stay in bed for another hour.</h2>
<h2 id="future">7. I'm definitely going to be drooling on your chest.</h2>
<h2 id="future">8. We'll play music on our cleaning days and we'll dance together.</h2>
<h2 id="future">9. You'll be gaming while I'll be drawing in the same room.</h2>
<h2 id="future">10. Grocery shopping will be something we'll do together.</h2>
<h2 id="future">11. Our anniversaries will be a competition as to who can surprise the other one first.</h2>
<h2 id="future">12. I'll find a way to make you eat breakfasts that you can enjoy.</h2>
<h2 id="future">13. Movie nights are gonna be SUPER cozy and we will make pillow forts.</h2>
<h2 id="future">14. We'll find ways to be childish. Pillow fights, jokes, running away from each other, you name it.</h2>
<h2 id="future">15. We'll still be playing games together.</h2>
