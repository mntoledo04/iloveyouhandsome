	<h1>Music for you and us</h1>

	<p>There are a couple of songs in my playlist that remind me of you or us. Here is a list of some of them! Think of it as a playlist I made for you. If you click on the image, it'll take you to the song on Youtube! :)</p>

<div class="song-info">
	<h2>Washing Machine Heart</h2>
	<p>by Mitski</p>
	<p>I was never really into Mitski, I kinda hated her but I got into this song because you've played it a couple of times. And now I like listening to it because it reminds me of you.</p>

<div class="song-info">
	<h2>Co2</h2>
	<p>by Prateek Kuhad</p>
	<p>I like this song because it sounds so soft and sweet. I like the whole lyric of deserving each other and the metaphors he uses.</p>

</div>

<div class="song-info">
	<h2>Terrified</h2>
	<p>by Jazmin Bean</p>
	<p>This was the song I had on replay when I was getting to know you. I was terrified of what could come from our relationship and how I would be treated.</p>

	</div>

<div class="song-info">
	<h2>don't be so hard on your own beauty</h2>
	<p>by yeule</p>
	<p>I listened to this song often a couple weeks after we were official. Because of my past experiences, I was scared to open up to you. Then I realized that I felt safe to be around you.</p>
	</div>

<div class="song-info">
	<h2>Would You Fall in Love with Me Again</h2>
	<p>by Jorge Rivera-Herrans, Anna Lee</p>
	<p>This one might be a little cringe since it's from a musical I think, but it sounds so pretty and sad. Because no matter what you do or where you'll go, I'll always love you.</p>

<div class="song-info">
	<h2>We'll Never Have Sex</h2>
	<p>by Leith Ross</p>
	<p>I chose this song because of the lyrics. I think it's self explanatory.</p>

	<h2>Waltz</h2>
	<p>by lilrosebush</p>
	<p> As the title and lyrics suggest, this song gives like princess dance kinda vibes. It sounds majestic, especially since it's a man's point of view.</p>

<div class="song-info">
	<h2>Apple Cider</h2>
	<p>by beabadoobee</p>
	<p>The song and lyrics for some reason brings me back to when we went to the apple farm together. It gives me feelings of fall, orange leaves, and chilly but sunny weather.</p>

	</a>
</div>

<div class="song-info">
	<h2>Pintura</h2>
	<p>by Patio Solar</p>
	<p>This song is in Spanish and I understand it as just enjoying each other's presence and trying to capture it in a painting. Makes me think of going on a picnic with you and watching the clouds go by.</p>

</div>

<div class="song-info">
	<h2>digital crush</h2>
	<p>by Powfu, Ouse, Ryan Librada</p>
	<p>I think it's a silly song about playing games online which is kind of how we started. Unlike what the song says, yes I'm yours, and yes you're hot.</p>
