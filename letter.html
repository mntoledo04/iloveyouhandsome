<p>My sweet boy,</p>

<p>It's crazy how far we've come. I often remember the fact we met on Bumble. Like, how did we ever get on that when we're both nervous and anxious people?! I think the world got tired of seeing us not together and gave us both he confidence to get on that app. One swipe and now we're past one year together. As nervous as I was, I was both curious and excited. Each day was something new and I looked forward to every notification I got from you. And I still do. I love when you text me good morning when you wake up. I love when you call me to go to sleep. I love the notification I get when it says you've arrived at my house. I love when you text of call me to ask if I can play games.</p>

<p>Playing games helped us connect when we were getting to know each other. From what I vaguely remember, we played Fortnite first. It was nerve-racking talking to you for the first time but playing a game made me feel better about talking to you. There couldn't be any awkward silences when we were playing since we had to communicate to play the game. After, we moved on to Minecraft which, of course, is one of my favorite games. It was so fun making a house with you, even though your eye for design is a little questionable. From the cute moments we had when taming pets to the competetive moments of eggwars, I loved playing that game with you. In between those moments we got to learn more about each other too. And after all that, we've moved on to Marvel Rivals. Now it's all competetive and yelling. In a fun way. I love being your duo.</p>

<p>I love spending time with you. I could never get bored of you. As much as things can get repetetive, we'll always find ways to make things fun. You're all I've ever wanted and all I didn't know I needed. You are my other half, and nothing makes me more happy than to be called yours.</p>

<p>I love you,</p>
